                    <p>The genetic risk profile is not diagnostic in nature and should not be used as one.  "High risk" for certain conditions does not necessarily mean that the patient will get that condition either now or in the future. Environmental factors and lifestyle related factors heavily influence the outcome of many of these conditions.
